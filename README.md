## PORTFOLIO

As a marketer of 10+ years, with a foundation in writing and campaign development, I've specialized in the healthcare and medtech/healthtech sectors for the bulk of that time. This is a snapshot of projects I've been deeply involved in at various levels, spanning across agencies, startups, enterprise brands & independent marketing support.

## Sample 2: J&J MedTech CARTO™ System - Integrated by Design Campaign

[https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/products/cardiovascular/carto/overview/](https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/products/cardiovascular/carto/overview/)

The CARTO System is the standard in advanced in 3D mapping technology across a wide range of electrophysiology procedures.

![CARTO Integrated by Design](JNJ_sample1.png)

Integrated by design: Our 'Integrated by design' approach goes far beyond a portfolio. Our suite of products have been designed and engineered to work seamlessly together, ensuring optimal functionality, and compatibility.

With real-time 3D visualization enabled by the CARTO™ 3 System and the integrated solutions designed to complement it, you have the insights needed for confidence in your outcomes.

**CARTO™ 3 System**

Advance your mapping capabilities through tools such as enhanced signal analysis and improved substrate characterization, and utilization of ultrasound technology with CARTO™ V8.

LAT Velocity Vectors (LVV) provides a representation of the activation wave velocity over a substrate map done in sinus rhythm or during pacing. Local Velocity Vectors aims to improve the specificity of localizing the most arrhythmogenic regions within the scar and reduce the need to characterize the substrate properties under different activation wavefronts.

The Stability+ algorithm continuously analyzes the overall movement of the ablation catheter, separating the movement due to respiration from the actual catheter movement. This continuous analysis reduces the time for initial indication of stability and the appearance of VISITAG™ Module Sites.
